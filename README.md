## Flutter Widgets.
Whenever you are going to code for building anything in Flutter, it will be inside a widget.

### Types of Widget

#### In Flutter, there are mainly two types of widget:

- StatelessWidget<br><br>

It remains static throughout its lifecycle.<br>
Ex. Text, Row, Column, Container, etc.

- StatefulWidget<br>

 It is dynamic because it can change the inner data during the widget lifetime.<br>
 This widget does not have a build() method. It has createState() method,<br>
 Ex. Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField.

### 1.Visible (Output and Input)<br>
- Text<br>
- FlatButton<br>
- RaisedButton<br>
- Image <br>
- Icon etc.<br>
### 2.Invisible (Layout and Control)<br>
- Column( It provides spacing between the widgets by using the mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment properties.)<br>
- Row<br>
- Center
- Padding<br>
- Stack(overlapping)<br>
- Scaffold(This widget provides a framework that allows you to add common material design elements like AppBar, Floating Action Buttons, Drawers, etc.
)<br>
